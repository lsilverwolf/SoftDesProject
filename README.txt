README

    LifeSorter is a command line application that is basically a smart to-do
    list. The application takes in a task, its due date, a priority from 1-5   
    provided by the user, and the hours that the user believes the task will 
    take. LifeSorter will then display an ordered list of your tasks, starting 
    with the task you should complete first. LifeSorter also gives you the 
    ability to modify any event at any time, and it is easy for you to remove 
    your events upon completion.
    
    All of the files for this project are located in the main branch of the 
    github repository at https://github.com/lsilverwolf/SoftDesProject.git.
    
    LifeSorter is the main function that should be run from terminal. Also 
    included in the repository are sorter.py, which takes care of the actual
    sorting of the events, and tkCalendar.py, which creates the calendar pop-up 
    window in the Create Event and Modify Event GUIs. The image file cal_icon.gif 
    is used to overlay the calendar icon on the calendar button.
